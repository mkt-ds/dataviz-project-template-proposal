# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is The World Happiness Report that uses survey data, demographic information and statistical analysis to rank 156 nations according to the happiness of their people.

A country’s overall happiness score is a composite of different factors collected in an annual worldwide survey, including 

GDP per capita
School years
Sustainable economic development
Employement Rate
Health expenditure
Government effectiveness
Female MPS (members of parliament)
Control of corruption

What factors contributes to happiness for different countries is interesting. For example more school years increases happiness in certain countries, it's probably correlated with getting more salaries after the end of the studies. 

???
I need to create another visual to show the relationship between each factors for each country.

???Overall, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Netherlands, Iceland are the happiest countries.


## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's an interactive chart showing the how much each of the above categories contributes to happiness for each country. Once a user selects a category it sorts the countries' hapiness scores from less happy to more happy and visualize it by each country. Each country is represented by a circle. The size of each country's population decides the size of the circle. Once the user click on a circle population and the happiness score shows up.

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments)

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * (insert your question or task here) How does the X vary over time?
 * (insert your question or task here) Is there any correlation between X and Y?
 * (insert your question or task here) Are there interesting spatial patterns in X?
 * (insert your question or task here) How many X are there across different Y?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)
